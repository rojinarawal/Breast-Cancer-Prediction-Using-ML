# ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using machine learning classification algorithms. The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset and explores multiple steps including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and feature selection.


## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Understand the structure and features of the Breast Cancer dataset.
- Apply machine learning models to predict cancer diagnoses.
- Perform feature selection to improve model performance.
- Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (EDA)
- Scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)

ðŸ§ª Models Used
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
